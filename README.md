# Problems
I ran into problems again, and I had the same issues as I did with Employee Tracker assingment. I google the error that kept popping up, and I try to fix it. Then I would rerun the project, and the errors still come up, or new error would arise. I have add pictures below of the errors that pop up. 

Also Heroku is a pain to work with, I could not get it to delopy, but I will continue to work on it, and I also added pictures of the error that popped up. 

# Solution
After looking over my code and checking for errors; I relize that I wrote the code incorrectly and that I missed spelled a word or two, and that I was using the incorrect localhost, but after I fixed everything I was able to get the application to work.
